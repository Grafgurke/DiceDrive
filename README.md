# Dice Drift

This is a game I fully developed in one month by myself using Unity.  
Only the SFX and music were AI-generated or sourced from various free sound effect websites like [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).  
All assets and art where created by myself using blender.

A full playthrough can be seen here: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1GTixTzEjZA)  
The full game can be downloaded under the release section.
